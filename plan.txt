Notes to Self:
Keep each PR focused and testable
Maintain backward compatibility during API evolution
Add comprehensive benchmarks before optimizing
Document performance gains with actual numbers
Use feature flags to make improvements opt-in initially
⚠️ Integral image approaches need sophisticated caching to be effective
✅ SIMD-friendly memory layout works well - chunked processing + row pointers
✅ Feature flags enable safe experimentation - can toggle optimizations on/off
✅ CLAHE preprocessing improves illumination robustness - 8x8 tiles with contrast limiting
✅ DetectorBuilder provides excellent UX - fluent API with presets and configuration validation
✅ Serde Configuration enables portable configs - JSON/TOML serialization with validation
