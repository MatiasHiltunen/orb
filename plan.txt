Notes to Self:
Keep each PR focused and testable
Maintain backward compatibility during API evolution
Add comprehensive benchmarks before optimizing
Document performance gains with actual numbers
Use feature flags to make improvements opt-in initially
⚠️ Integral image approaches need sophisticated caching to be effective
✅ SIMD-friendly memory layout works well - chunked processing + row pointers
✅ Feature flags enable safe experimentation - can toggle optimizations on/off
✅ CLAHE preprocessing improves illumination robustness - 8x8 tiles with contrast limiting
✅ DetectorBuilder provides excellent UX - fluent API with presets and configuration validation

Target Metrics:
Baseline: 14ms, ~1900 keypoints on 567×567
After Rolling-Window: 15.3ms (+4.4% slower) 
After SIMD Layout: 13.9ms (9.2% faster than previous, slightly faster than baseline!)
CLAHE Preprocessing: 2.9ms (256×256), ~90% overhead for illumination robustness
DetectorBuilder Fast Preset: 332ms (567×567), 2516 keypoints, excellent UX
DetectorBuilder Quality Preset: 517ms (567×567), 1708 keypoints, comprehensive features
